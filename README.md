# nativefier-generators
The idea of these scripts is to create a desktop app from a web app using nativefier, creating desktop entries and fixing icons.

Available apps:
- Whatsapp
- Jira
- Bitbucket

## Disclaimer
For now, it's only working on Ubuntu because it's my main OS (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS).
The apps above are apps that I constantly use, probably this list will increase.
